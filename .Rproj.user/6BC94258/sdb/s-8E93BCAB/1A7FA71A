This is a simulated data set which aims to predict which customers will default on their credit card debt; it contains the variables, `income`, `student` and `balance`. These variables can be used to predict the outcome given in `default`.\n\nThe app contains 3 main functions: Data, Histogram and Model.\n\nClick on the following link to access the app: https://legoh.shinyapps.io/myapp/\n\n--- .class #id \n\n## Data \n\nThe data set used in this application is given as follows:\n```{r}\nlibrary(ISLR);data(Default);head(Default)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Histogram\n\nThe histogram allows for the user to select which variable, `income` or `balance` to plot a histogram on. It is controlled mainly by the following function:\n```{r, message=FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}\nhist(Default$income, breaks = 30, col = 'blue', border = 'white', \n     main = \"Histogram of income\",xlab = \"income\")\n```\n\n---\n\n## Model\n\nThe modeling technique used for this app is a simple logistic regression model. It is run by the \"glm\" method in the caret package. The user is allowed to choose the training data set size as well as the variables used. The output of the model will be the confusion matrix and model metrics.\n```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}\nlibrary(caret)\nset.seed(1234)\ntrainIn = createDataPartition(Default$default, p = 0.6, list = FALSE) \ntrain = Default[trainIn,]\ntest = Default[-trainIn,]\nmodel = train(default~., method = \"glm\",data = train)\npredictions = predict(object = model, test)\nconfusionMatrix(predictions,test$default)$byClass\nconfusionMatrix(predictions,test$default)$table\n```\n\n\n\n\n",
